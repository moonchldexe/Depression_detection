# depression_detection
building depression detection model using multiple word embedding and multiple ML alogrithms for analyzing textual data from twitter.


after comparing all the ML algorithms and word embedding, I chose SVM (support vector machine) as my ultimate model to carry-on and tryout to increase the accuracy. my proposed methodology includes Tf-idf + SVM and later on applying alot of Optimization algorithms. such as Flower pollination, PSO (particle swarm optimization), grey wolf, Beed colony, Ant colony etc. 

the best result I achieved are with proposed methodology + Grey wolf.
